# Infrastructure Perspective Documentation

## 📘 Introduction

The infrastructure perspective focuses on understanding how a project is built, deployed, configured, and operated in real-world environments. It supports DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and SREs in quickly assessing infrastructure needs, identifying risks, and establishing reliable and secure deployment pipelines. The goal is to reduce guesswork and ensure that any application can be consistently and confidently deployed and operated.

---

## 📋 Summary

This module analyzes infrastructure-related elements extracted from the codebase and configuration files. It identifies runtime requirements, deployment strategies, environment configurations, observability practices, secrets handling, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code components. Semantic enrichment via LLMs supports insight into undocumented or implicit patterns.

## 🧑‍💻 Key Personas to Use It

- **DevOps Engineers**: To prepare build, deploy, and scaling strategies with confidence.
- **Platform Engineers**: To understand runtime needs and infrastructure dependencies for integration into a platform.
- **SREs**: To assess health checks, logging, and observability guarantees.
- **Security Engineers**: To audit secrets management and configuration exposure.

---

## 🌟 Key Features to Be Implemented

- Detection of Dockerfiles and containerization strategy
- Inference of runtime environment from code and config
- Analysis of `.env` and environment variable usage
- Extraction and summarization of CI/CD pipeline steps
- Detection of secrets in code or config
- Mapping of external dependencies (DBs, message queues, third-party APIs)
- Detection of health checks, logging, monitoring, and metrics
- Classification of deployment models (monolith, multi-service, serverless)
- Infrastructure-as-Code scanning (Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes YAML)
- LLM-powered summaries of deployment requirements and risks

---

## 🧰 Technology Stack

- **Python** for extraction and orchestration
- **LangGraph** for multi-step processing (RAG++ orchestration)
- **Tree-sitter / AST parsers** for parsing Dockerfiles, YAML, Terraform
- **FAISS / Chroma** for embedding infra-related chunks
- **LLMs** (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) for configuration explanation and infra reasoning
- **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins DSL** parsing modules
- **dotenv parsers**, Dockerfile analyzers, and shell detection tools

---

## 🎯 Key Main Value Deliveries

- Clear summary of build and runtime requirements
- Validation of deployment and scaling readiness
- Identification of potential risks (e.g., hardcoded secrets)
- Mapping of infrastructure dependencies and provisioning needs
- CI/CD visibility with potential improvements
- Observability and health insights across components

---

## 🧾 Artifacts to Be Generated

- Infrastructure summary report (JSON)
  - Docker, runtime, ports, envs, secrets, logging, etc.
- LLM-generated Markdown/HTML explanation for human readability
- CI/CD pipeline visualization (nodes + steps)
- Infrastructure dependency map (e.g., services to DBs, queues)
- Embeddings with metadata for infra files (Docker, YAML, etc.)
- Risk and observability checklist per project

## 🕸️ Strategies to Deliver Value via Web App Platform

- **Infra Dashboard**:
  - Containers detected, ports, secrets, deployment model, cloud readiness
- **CI/CD Viewer**:
  - Visualization of steps, tools, and environments used
- **Config & Secrets Inspector**:
  - `.env`, exposed credentials, usage of secrets managers
- **Dependency Graphs**:
  - Databases, queues, APIs, volumes mapped per service/module
- **LLM Infra Summary Panel**:
  - Plain-language explanation of how to deploy and run the project
- **Security Panel**:
  - Tokens, passwords, SSH keys detection and handling best practices
- **Deployment Checklist View**:
  - Ports exposed, logs enabled, health check routes detected or missing
