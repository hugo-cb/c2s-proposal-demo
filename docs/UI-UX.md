# User Journey Planning & UI/UX Design

This document outlines the personas, user journeys in Gherkin format, UI screens and elements, linking strategy, and UX considerations for the platform, covering Engineering, Architecture, Infrastructure, Business, and cross-perspective integrations.

---

## üé≠ Personas and Expectations

### Developer / Tech Lead (Engineering)
- Expects detailed insights on code quality, test coverage, refactoring opportunities, and overall maintainability.

### Software Architect (Architecture)
- Wants clarity on system structure, layering, adherence to architectural decisions, patterns, and system integrity.

### DevOps / Platform Engineer (Infrastructure)
- Seeks clear visibility on deployment readiness, infrastructure dependencies, security, and observability.

### Product Owner / Business Analyst (Business)
- Needs a clear understanding of implemented features, functional domain coverage, and alignment with business goals.

## üö© User Journeys (Gherkin Syntax)

### Engineering Perspective

**Feature:** Understand Code Quality
```gherkin
Scenario: Developer reviews code quality
Given the user is logged in
And selects a project from the dashboard
When the user views the engineering perspective
Then they see quality scores, code smells, and complexity metrics
And they receive actionable LLM refactoring suggestions
```

### Architecture Perspective

**Feature:** Validate Architectural Expectations
```gherkin
Scenario: Architect confirms system layers and patterns
Given the user is on the Architecture dashboard
And auto-generated expectations are visible
When the user reviews the architectural layers and patterns
Then they validate detected versus expected layers and patterns
And refine inputs as necessary to update accuracy scores
```

### Infrastructure Perspective

**Feature:** Ensure Deployment Readiness
```gherkin
Scenario: DevOps engineer assesses deployment readiness
Given the user accesses the Infrastructure dashboard
When they review detected infrastructure artifacts
Then they identify missing or present artifacts such as Dockerfile, CI/CD, or Healthchecks
And export an actionable infrastructure checklist
```

### Business Perspective

**Feature:** Verify Business Domain Coverage
```gherkin
Scenario: Product owner checks feature implementation
Given the user navigates to the Business dashboard
When they explore the capability map and feature matrix
Then they verify implementation of key business features and domains
And edit expectations to reflect business priorities accurately
```

### Cross-Perspective Integration

**Feature:** Comprehensive Analysis
```gherkin
Scenario: User performs comprehensive analysis review
Given the user accesses the integrated analysis view
When reviewing overall accuracy scores across all perspectives
Then they clearly see gaps and strengths in analysis coverage
And receive recommendations for actionable improvements
```

---

### Anchor Linking (Navigation)

- Dashboard ‚Üí Engineering / Architecture / Infrastructure / Business / Integrated View
- Perspective screens ‚Üí back to Dashboard, cross-links to other perspective screens, detailed item exploration links

---

## üéØ UX Considerations & Functionalities

### Planned & Implemented Functionalities
- Automatic accuracy expectation generation from initial analysis
- Editable user inputs for accuracy expectations
- Immediate accuracy recalculations upon input adjustments
- Traceable LLM-generated recommendations and suggestions
- Exporting and sharing of structured analysis artifacts

### Suggested & Additional Functionalities
- **Alert & Notification System**: Automated notifications triggered by significant changes, such as:
  - Sudden decrease/increase in accuracy scores.
  - Disappearance or appearance of critical artifacts (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
  - Changes in detected architecture style or layers.
  - Increased complexity or decrease in test coverage.
- **Trend Analysis & Historical Comparisons**: Allow users to view trends and comparisons over time:
  - Codebase growth rate.
  - Historical accuracy analysis score comparisons.
  - Evolution of code complexity metrics.
- **Actionable Insights & Recommendations Panel**: AI-generated, proactive recommendations prompting users to take immediate action based on recent changes or identified risks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è User Engagement & Passive Experience

Considering the user's passive role, the platform will proactively support decision-making by continuously monitoring:
- Code changes via GitHub integration and CI/CD pipeline events.
- Analysis quality metrics and accuracy expectation adjustments.
- Automatically generated alerts and proactive notifications to highlight significant events and anomalies, thus actively engaging the user to respond timely and effectively.
