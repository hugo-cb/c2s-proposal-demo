# Accuracy Analysis Documentation

This document summarizes all decisions, discussions, designed strategies, and the rationale behind implementing the Accuracy Analysis across different perspectives of the platform. It aims to clearly communicate the completeness, reliability, and confidence of the analyses, enabling users to better understand the coverage and accuracy of their codebase evaluation.

---

## üìò Introduction

Accuracy Analysis provides transparent insights into how comprehensively and accurately the platform analyzes a codebase from multiple critical perspectives (Engineering, Architecture, Infrastructure, and Business). The platform calculates accuracy scores to reveal how much of the user‚Äôs expectations are effectively covered by the analysis and identifies potential gaps clearly and objectively.

---

## üéØ Goals and Motivations for Accuracy Analysis

The Accuracy Analysis feature was motivated by the need for:

- **Transparency:** Clearly communicate the depth, completeness, and reliability of the platform‚Äôs analyses.
- **Confidence:** Help users trust the automated insights by quantifying analysis coverage and providing traceable explanations.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Provide actionable feedback by highlighting analysis gaps and areas needing manual refinement.
- **Engagement and Clarity:** Allow users to refine and update the automatically generated expectations, creating interactive engagement and ownership over the accuracy assessment.

## üß† Rationale Behind Accuracy Analysis

- **Engineering Perspective:** Designed to objectively measure coverage of static analysis and automated insights. It motivates users to ensure all relevant files are correctly analyzed, promoting completeness and reliability.
- **Architecture Perspective:** Based on the rationale that architectural validation often involves subjective expectations. Accuracy Analysis initially generates these expectations automatically, then compares them against actual code structure and patterns, motivating deeper architectural alignment.
- **Infrastructure Perspective:** Driven by DevOps engineers needing confidence that critical infrastructure elements like containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and health checks are adequately covered. It provides objective checks against user expectations to encourage stronger operational readiness.
- **Business Perspective:** Recognizes that business stakeholders need to understand if the implemented functionality aligns closely with intended business objectives and regulatory requirements. Accuracy Analysis provides a structured way to validate this alignment and motivates iterative refinement of domain coverage.

## üõ† Perspectives and Calculation Strategies

### 1. Engineering Perspective (Objective Accuracy)

- **Methodology:** 
  - Objectively assesses coverage by comparing analyzed files against total files present.

- **Structure Example:**
```json
{
  "total_files": 100,
  "analyzed_files": 95,
  "llm_summarized": 90,
  "coverage_detected": true,
  "accuracy_score": 0.95
}
```

---

### 2. Architecture Perspective (User-Input Driven Accuracy)

- **Methodology:** 
  - Auto-generates expectations on architectural layers, patterns, and styles.
  - Measures detected artifacts against these initial expectations.

- **Example Input Structure:**
```json
{
  "expected_layers": ["API", "Domain", "Infra"],
  "expected_patterns": ["Repository", "Adapter"]
}
```

- **Accuracy Result:**
```json
{
  "matched_layers": ["API", "Domain"],
  "missed_layers": ["Infra"],
  "matched_patterns": ["Repository"],
  "architecture_accuracy": 0.75,
  "source": "auto_generated"
}
```

---

### 3. Infrastructure Perspective (User-Input Driven Accuracy)

- **Methodology:** 
  - Auto-generates expectations about critical infrastructure artifacts (Docker, CI/CD pipelines, health checks).
  - Verifies actual presence within the codebase.

- **Example Input Structure:**
```json
{
  "expected_artifacts": ["Dockerfile", "CI/CD", "Healthcheck"]
}
```

- **Accuracy Result:**
```json
{
  "found_artifacts": ["Dockerfile", "CI/CD"],
  "missing_artifacts": ["Healthcheck"],
  "infrastructure_accuracy": 0.66,
  "source": "auto_generated"
}
```

---

### 4. Business Perspective (User-Input Driven Accuracy)

- **Methodology:** 
  - Auto-generates initial business-domain expectations and assesses coverage by detecting corresponding code implementations.

- **Example Input Structure:**
```json
{
  "expected_domains": ["User Management", "Payments", "Scheduling"]
}
```

- **Accuracy Result:**
```json
{
  "matched_domains": ["User Management", "Payments"],
  "unmatched_domains": ["Scheduling"],
  "business_accuracy": 0.66,
  "source": "auto_generated"
}
```

## üìÇ Artifacts Generated by Accuracy Analysis

### 1. Accuracy Visibility Report (JSON)

Summarizes accuracy scores and detailed matching information across perspectives.

### 2. Accuracy Matrix CSV (Exportable Artifact)

Structured data exportable for external analysis.

### 3. Editable Input Files

- `expected_architecture.json`
- `expected_infrastructure.json`
- `expected_business.json`

Facilitates user interaction and manual refinement of analysis expectations.

### 4. Input Diff Reports

Highlights differences between automatically generated and user-refined expectations.

### 5. Audit Logs

Tracks historical user modifications to analysis inputs, fostering transparency and traceability.

### 6. LLM Traceability Reports

Records LLM reasoning processes behind auto-generated expectations, promoting explainability.

---

## üöÄ Initial Auto-generation Strategy (Important Decision)

Initially, the platform automatically generates the inputs needed to calculate accuracy, derived directly from the initial code analysis. This approach ensures immediate visibility and high initial confidence in analysis completeness, promoting user interaction through refinement opportunities. As users adjust these inputs, the accuracy scores dynamically reflect these changes, motivating continuous improvement and user-driven insights.

---

## üìä UX Integration & User Journey

Accuracy Analysis is seamlessly integrated within user journeys across all perspectives. It begins by providing immediate high-confidence visibility, clearly identifying initial analysis gaps. Users are then encouraged to refine expectations, enhancing both trust in automated results and engagement in the ongoing improvement of their analysis processes.
