 # Business Perspective Documentation
 
 ## 📘 Introduction
 
 The business perspective focuses on aligning source code with the strategic goals, functional domains, and key business processes it supports. This perspective allows stakeholders to trace how code modules relate to features, users, regulatory requirements, and domain models — making the system more explainable, auditable, and aligned with business value.

 ## 📋 Summary
 
 This module analyzes code and metadata to extract meaningful representations of how the system supports business operations. It leverages naming conventions, file structures, test case semantics, and LLM-assisted interpretation to map business capabilities, core features, and compliance-sensitive components.

 ## 🧑‍💼 Key Personas to Use It
 
 - **Product Managers**: To understand where business features are implemented and trace delivery impact.
 - **Business Analysts**: To validate feature coverage and link code to use cases.
 - **Compliance Officers**: To identify components related to regulation-sensitive features (e.g., data privacy, security).
 - **Engineering Leads**: To prioritize refactoring or modernization based on business-critical paths.
 - **Stakeholders/Clients**: To visualize how technology serves business objectives.

 ## 🌟 Key Features to Be Implemented
 
 - Detection of business domains and capabilities
 - Module-to-feature mapping with summaries
 - LLM-powered inference of business responsibilities per file/module
 - Domain grouping based on folder structures, naming, and aggregates
 - Highlighting of PII, HIPAA, GDPR, or other regulatory references
 - Integration with testing logic to find business rule validation
 - Output structured by capabilities, processes, and entities

 ## 🧰 Technology Stack
 
 - **LangGraph** for orchestrated pipeline to extract and reason across files
 - **LLMs** (e.g., GPT, Claude) to interpret business meaning of modules
 - **Regex + file structure heuristics** to detect domain and feature boundaries
 - **Metadata tagging** of capabilities (auth, billing, reporting, etc.)
 - **Embedding-based retrieval** of business-related code sections
 - **Code + test case analysis** to extract business rules and behaviors

 ## 🎯 Key Main Value Deliveries
 
 - Visibility into where core business logic lives in the system
 - Mapping of code modules to product features or use cases
 - Enhanced domain understanding for cross-functional stakeholders
 - Traceability of features to compliance-sensitive areas
 - Explainability layer between code and value streams

 ## 🧾 Artifacts to Be Generated
 
 - Business capability map (JSON): module to domain mapping
 - Feature traceability matrix: feature → code modules → key methods
 - Domain model outline: entities, aggregates, and relationships
 - Regulation-aware report: modules handling sensitive data
 - Semantic summaries: LLM-based description of responsibilities
 - Heatmap of business-critical vs. support components

 ## 🕸️ Strategies to Deliver Value via Web App Platform
 
 - **Business Map View**:
   - Displays grouped modules by business capability or domain
 - **Feature Explorer Panel**:
   - Feature → underlying files and logic with business description
 - **Domain Relationship Graph**:
   - How domains/entities interact and which code drives them
 - **Compliance View**:
   - Highlights areas linked to PII, payments, access control, etc.
 - **Summary Widgets**:
   - “This project supports 6 business capabilities across 22 modules”
 - **Narrative Flow Panel**:
   - Show system behavior in terms of user goals and business outcomes
